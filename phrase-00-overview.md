# Overview

[Phrase](https://phrase.com/) (earlier: Memsource) is a cloud-based translation management system, which also includes a CAT tool. It is completely web-based, meaning it is used via a web browser.

In this project, Phrase CAT web editor ver. 23.18.1 was used.

Phrase was chosen because the author uses a Phrase CAT editor thanks to the courtesy of a translation agency. However, a trial account was created to configure Markdown filters and import the test file.

The discussion of the test file in Phrase is grouped into three sections:

1. [Settings](phrase-01-settings)
2. [Results](phrase-02-results)
3. [Summary and recommendations](phrase-03-summary-and-recommendations)
