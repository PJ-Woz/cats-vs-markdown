Trados Studio 2022

# Overview

[Trados Studio](https://www.trados.com/products/trados-studio/whats-new-studio-2022.html) is the oldest CAT software and often regarded as an industry standard. It works as a desktop application.

In this project, Trados Studio 2022 ver. 17.0.4.13209 was used.

Trados Studio 2022 (also simply "Trados") was chosen because a licence was available to the author and it is [the most popular CAT among translators](https://go.proz.com/blog/cat-tool-use-by-translators-what-are-they-using "Proz article on CAT use").

The discussion of the test file in Trados is grouped into three sections:

1. [Settings](trados-01-settings)
2. [Results](trados-02-results)
3. [Summary and recommendations](trados-03-summary-and-recommendations)

Next section: [*Trados Studio 2022 — Settings*](trados-01-settings)
